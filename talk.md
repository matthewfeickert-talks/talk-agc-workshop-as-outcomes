# Talk Overview

.large[
* .bold[Time]: 20 minutes talk + 10 minutes questions
* .bold[Notes from organizers]:
   - Slides can just advertise/summarize available "features" at various facilities that could be useful for AGC style workflows.
      - Example: UChicago we have now also Triton supporting 70 GPUs
   - It would be ideal to test them also
   - Nice example to test if AGC notebook can run all the way, and if not what is missing.
