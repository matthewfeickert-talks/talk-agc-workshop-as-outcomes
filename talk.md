# Talk Overview

.large[
* .bold[Time]: 20 minutes talk + 10 minutes questions
* .bold[Notes from organizers]:
   - Summary talk of the workshop from the Analysis Systems perspective
   - Friday morning slot is for the area leads to condense all the workshop discussions of relevance for the area into a plan for the next steps, and most importantly for us a plan towards a showcase event in September

# Goal to focus on: AGC showcase event 2023

.huge[
* This workshop has focused on what the current state of work is
* As we look to future iterations of the Analysis Grand Challenge need to now look at .bold[what needs to be accomplished] to realize goals raised in discussions.
* Have the [iris-hep/analysis-grand-challenge/ Issue #64](https://github.com/iris-hep/analysis-grand-challenge/issues/64) to guide us as well
* Development and application focuses:
   - Dask-ification of the Analysis Systems ecosystem (reference: [Lindsey's talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1260431/contributions/5315181/))
   - Integration of Machine Learning workflows into the Analysis Systems pipeline (reference: [Elliott's talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1260431/contributions/5315191/))
   - Exploring `correctionslib` (reference: [Andrew's talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1260431/contributions/5315192/))
   - Integration testing of the Analysis Systems pipeline with itself and Coffea-casa

* Dask Migration: `coffea` .bold[&rarr;] `coffea` CalVer, Awkward .bold[&rarr;] `dask_awkward`,<br> `hist` .bold[&rarr;] `dask_histogram`

.bold[Action items]
   - Perform integration testing with coffea CalVer (pre-)releases
   <br>(AS related Scikit-HEP tools already compatible with Awkward v2)
   - Coordinate discussions with Dask devs for the Institute on reaching HEP scale
   <br>(target SciPy 2023)
   - Upskill in workflows using Dask / Revise AGC analyses
