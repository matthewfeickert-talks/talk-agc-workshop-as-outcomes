# Goal to focus on: AGC showcase event 2023

.huge[
* This workshop has focused on what the current state of work is
* As we look to future iterations of the Analysis Grand Challenge need to now look at .bold[what needs to be accomplished] to realize goals raised in discussions.
* Have the [iris-hep/analysis-grand-challenge/ Issue #64](https://github.com/iris-hep/analysis-grand-challenge/issues/64) to guide us as well
* Development and application focuses:
   - Dask-ification of the Analysis Systems ecosystem (reference: [Lindsey's talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1260431/contributions/5315181/))
   - Integration of Machine Learning workflows into the Analysis Systems pipeline (reference: [Elliott's talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1260431/contributions/5315191/))
   - Exploring `correctionslib` (reference: [Andrew's talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1260431/contributions/5315192/))
   - Integration testing of the Analysis Systems pipeline with itself and Coffea-casa
