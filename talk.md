# Goal to focus on: AGC showcase event 2023

.huge[
* This workshop has focused on what the current state of work is
* As we look to future iterations of the Analysis Grand Challenge need to now look at .bold[what needs to be accomplished] to realize goals raised in discussions.
* Have the [iris-hep/analysis-grand-challenge/ Issue #64](https://github.com/iris-hep/analysis-grand-challenge/issues/64) to guide us as well
* Development and application focuses:
   - Dask-ification of the Analysis Systems ecosystem (reference: [Lindsey's talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1260431/contributions/5315181/))
   - Integration of Machine Learning workflows into the Analysis Systems pipeline (reference: [Elliott's talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1260431/contributions/5315191/))
   - Exploring `correctionslib` (reference: [Andrew's talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1260431/contributions/5315192/))
   - Integration testing of the Analysis Systems pipeline with itself and Coffea-casa

* Dask Migration: `coffea` .bold[&rarr;] `coffea` CalVer, Awkward .bold[&rarr;] `dask_awkward`,<br> `hist` .bold[&rarr;] `dask_histogram`

.bold[Action items]
   - Perform integration testing with coffea CalVer (pre-)releases
   <br>(AS related Scikit-HEP tools already compatible with Awkward v2)
   - Coordinate discussions with Dask devs for the Institute on reaching HEP scale
   <br>(target SciPy 2023)
   - Upskill in workflows using Dask / Revise AGC analyses

# ML Pipeline Integration

.large[
.kol-2-3[
.bold[Action items]
* Integrate MLflow and Triton into workflows
* Follow up with Ops program for expanding support of Triton to more Analysis Facilities
* Follow up with [Dask-ML](https://ml.dask.org/) devs to ensure integration with MLflow works
* Understand Trition and ML framework compatibility
   - XGBoost's JSON is painful with Trition, and fine to use PyTorch/TensorFlow, but if someone wants to use XGBoost should avoid limiting them
* See [DOMA closeout talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1260431/timetable/?view=standard#2-doma-workshop-outcomes-and-a) on model management

# Correctionslib

.large[
* Alex's point on

.bold[Action items]
* Using correctionslib might be too much for September, but push hard here nonetheless
]

# Integration Testing of AS pipeline

.huge[

* Workflows are becoming more complex with new features and (differing) requirements
* Need to be testing Analysis Systems pipeline with
   - All Analysis Systems components
   - Against current Coffea-casa releases
   - At all Analysis Facilities

.bold[Action items]

* Setup integration testing infrastructure to make this straightforward
*

# Integration with Analysis Facilities

.huge[

* Make it easy for Analysis Facilities to support the tools that we need
   - See [DOMA closeout talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1260431/timetable/?view=standard#2-doma-workshop-outcomes-and-a) for .bold[Coffea Shoppe]

.bold[Action items]
* Test regularly at all US Analysis Facilities
   - Reduce container image build redundancy with DOMA/Coffea-casa
* Establish workflows with the operations programs

# Summary
.huge[
.kol-2-3[
* In very good shape for moving towards goals for Analysis Grand Challenge showcase event!
* Have lots to focus on to reach there
